- **Password Security**: Simple hashing algorithm (for demonstration)
- **Platform**: Windows-compatible (uses conio.h for input handling)

### 🔐 Security Features

- Passwords are never displayed in plain text
- Basic password hashing to avoid storing plain text passwords
- Input validation to enforce strong passwords
- Username uniqueness enforcement

### 📋 Requirements

- C++17 compatible compiler
- Windows operating system (for conio.h functionality)
- File system write permissions

### 🚀 How to Compile and Run

#### Using G++ (MinGW)

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 login_registration.cpp -o login_registration
./login_registration
```

#### Using Visual Studio

1. Create a new C++ console application
2. Add the `login_registration.cpp` file to your project
3. Build and run the application

### ⚠️ Important Notes
